# MyBeautifulCityApp

App about city Wielun. It is disign to adapt to window size - changing from list view to list and detail view when screen expanded. 

At the start point I added splashscreen which shows a short sentence about city and a photo. 
After that the navController directs user to main_screen which is in smaller screen list of places to visit with localization - 
when cliking on card the details about place are shown. In expanded screen list and detail are shown in row.
